# Grid-field-Sorter-with-comparators
•	Created a program that utilizes the Selection Sort algorithm to organize grid-fields with the use of two different comparators
•	Grid-field samples are provided
•	Grid-fields are sorted based on their alphabet, width, and then height, in ascending order
•	Alphabetical order is based on the ASCII value of the letters
•	Challenges include, the manipulation of 1-D arrays, Selection Sorting algorithms, Usage of Comparators, and OOP 

"Sorter.java" is the main class
"Record.java" represents a single grid-field that is read
"RecordColumnComparator" represents the comparator for the height of the grid-field
"RecordRowComparator" represents the comparator for the width of the grid-field
"RecordLexicographicComparator" represents the comparator to compare the ASCII values of 2 grid-fields
